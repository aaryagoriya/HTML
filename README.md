# HTML Learning Repository

Welcome to my HTML Learning Repository.

This project was created as part of my journey to learn and practice **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**. It includes examples of various HTML tags and structures that are fundamental to building web pages.

## What You'll Find

In this repository, you'll find:

- Basic page structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Text formatting tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<br>`, etc.)
- Links and images (`<a>`, `<img>`)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
- Tables (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`)
- Forms (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, etc.)
- Semantic elements (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.)
- Media tags (`<audio>`, `<video>`)
- And more

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Practice using every common HTML tag
- Understand the structure and semantics of HTML documents
- Build a strong foundation for further web development learning (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)

## Work in Progress

This repository is a work in progress, as I continue to explore and learn new tags and best practices in HTML.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the files, open them in your browser, and modify them to see how different HTML tags behave.
